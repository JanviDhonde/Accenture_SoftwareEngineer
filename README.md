# Accenture_SoftwareEngineer
I completed the Accenture Nordics Developer Software Engineering Job Simulation where I strengthened my skills in Agile development, programming, debugging, and testing. I gained hands-on experience in software architecture and security, as well as working with SDLC models (Agile &amp; Waterfall), enhancing my software engineering capabilities.
